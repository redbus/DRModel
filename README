# Sample Usage
See the TestProject code for an example of how to use the DRModel class. There are two custom data object getters written in DRModel.m already

The DRModel Class is uses SynthesizeSingleton.h to create a shared object. The object is available like this:
[[DRModel sharedDRModel] __your custom object getter__];
